### History

<br>

* **Mutant #9514** was licensed to **The Writer's Room** on **Jan 1, 2022**. New York Times bestseller writer **Neil Strauss**, in collaboration with the community of license holders, is working on the first blockchain-based collaborative writing book of history. **[[More info](https://www.jenkinsthevalet.com/press)]**

* Mutants and superheroes share some characteristics. Both can do amazing things. And that is the reason for **Mutant #9514** to start the first campaign in the metaverse to raise funds and awareness about **Infantile Cerebral Palsy** and help little superheroes like Mario, a five-years-old kid whose dream is to be able to run one day. The campaign **#mariowantstorun** has a virtual space in Decentraland and people all over the world have been able to participate. More information:

Additionally, Perris Mackey's artwork will include an easter egg with the hashtag **#mariowantstorun** to support the campaign.
