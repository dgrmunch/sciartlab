# Research

## Current projects

* **Virtual Reality in Neuromedicine and Therapy**: We are starting to explore applied therapeutical uses of Virtual Reality in collaboration with a partner university (to be announced).

* [Decentraland District](https://dgrmunch.github.io/blog/blog/2017/building-a-distributed-metaverse.html): After some of the SciArt Lab Metaverse components were published in Github and Twitter, we were mentioned a couple of times in the Week of A-Frame series (supported by Mozilla). Some weeks later, in 2017, we were contacted by the team of Decentraland offering support for our project. Decentraland is one of the first blockchain-based metaverses before the term was even a hype. They raised $24 million during their ICO. We got an initial donation of 200 LAND from Decentraland and 8 LAND from other donors, which led us to start building the *SciArt Lab Metaverse* as a private district on the Ethereum blockchain. This project currently serves as a host for different research and experimental projects, leasing programs and collaborations.

* [NFT Licensing and Artistic Partnerships](projects/mutant9514.md): We support new creators in the NFT space and the Metaverse. We offer collaborations to emerging collectives and artists. We are part of **Bored Ape Yatch Club**. We are also part of other NFT Communities and projects like **World of Women**, **Women Rise**, **Boss Beauties** and some others. As owners of the IP over those artworks, we authorize derivatives over pieces of our NFT Collection for specific projects, non-profit compaigns, artistic experiments, or branding purposes.

* [P2P Schools](projects/p2p-schools-notes.md): Project to bring the principles of the **commons-based peer-production** approach to an educational context, embracing respectful practices and concepts like self-guided education, embodied cognition and sustainability. 

## Finished Projects

* [Alda-tabs](https://dgrmunch.github.io/blog/blog/2017/alda-tabs.html): Domain Specific Language for Guitar Players in the Java Virtual Machine: A piece of software to help guitar players to “execute” their music notes in the JVM, compose songs and get audio feedback with basic tab syntax.

* [Artificial Intelligence Music Generation](https://dgrmunch.github.io/blog/blog/2017/digital-music-creation.html):  Set of cellular automata with emergent properties for music composition. Each cellular automaton is able to compose its own music based on simple rules, evolving while it plays synthetic instruments in Ableton Live or external devices through MIDI events.

* [SciArt 2D Simulator](projects/sciart2DSimulator.md): 2D Graphics Engine for agent-based modeling, artificial life and educational games.

* [SciArt Lab Metaverse components](https://dgrmunch.github.io/blog/blog/2017/building-a-distributed-metaverse.html): The potential of WebVR is amazing. It leads to new opportunities for developers and content creators, fixing the problem of interoperability between three-dimensional environments by bringing the community together around web standards (compatible with any virtual reality hardware and accessible from any web browser). We have created open-source virtual reality components to be used in our SciArt projects.

* [xmunch atomspace](https://github.com/dgrmunch/xmunch-atomspace/wiki): Visual tool for the dynamic construction of neural and semantic networks for knowledge representation, reasoning and learning in an abstract space of atoms.

* [GAVC](projects/gavc.md): Generative Art and Visual Complexity: This project aims to explore the potential of algorithmic implementations to generate visual art.

* [Soundbox](https://github.com/SciArtLab/soundbox): Experimental digital environment for synthetic music creation. Transform your voice or your instrument in a MIDI interface.


## Research topics

### Current

#### Virtual Reality in Research, Education and Neuromedicine

During the last years we have been exploring how the SciArt Lab could contribute to:

* The use of VR technologies in education.
* The use of VR in neuroscience.
* The emergence of the distributed metaverse. 

Also, we are studying the use of VR in STEAM education and in the P2P Schools project. 

We have also developed several WebVR components with a triple goal:

* Create our own immersive experiments in virtual reality for phenomenological and artistic explorations.
* Contribute to the upcoming 3D Web, sharing content and open-source components with the idea of a future distributed metaverse in mind (built on the top of a-frame + ipfs/hypercore).
* Build the facilities of the SciArt Lab in a virtual space (Decentraland), in order to have a place always accessible, independently of our location in the physical world, for research and education purposes.


#### DIY Neuroscience

DIY Neuroscience can be used for single-subject research, but also in STEAM educational events. 

We are currently studying the potential of **DIY Neuroscience**, designing experiments based on EEG low-cost technology and exploring the possibilities of electroencephalography + educational electronics (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Makey-Makey...) in STEAM educational events.

We are also interested in single-subject research and the potential of correlating phenomenological investigations with its neurophysiological correlates, as much as the combination of neuroscience with the SciArt/Making approach, both within the context of VR and artistic production. 


### Past

####  Complex Systems and Artificial Life

Studying the emergence of complex behavior in self-organizing systems, such as artificial life simulations, biochemical experiments o social organisms.


#### Sound Synthesis and Computational Music Composition

Hacking music with both sound synthesis and algorithmic composition, combining experimental music with new technologies. Discovering how coding and music can be combined by prototyping domain-specific languages, enabling self-composed songs with genetic algorithms or re-discovering MIDI controllers to create audio art.


####  Data Visualization, Digital Art and Visual Explorations

Some of our projects are focused in the development of data visualization tools. Others explore new ways of expression, visual ethnography and photographic/film representation through the use of physical methods, lighting and digital processing. Others are oriented to computer graphics, artificial systems simulation, educational games and generative art.

#### Constructed Languages and Knowledge Representation

Exploring the intersection of artificial agent-based models with constructed languages and discovering news ways for knowledge representation, conscript development and visual languages design.
